This is my good old Vim setup, that has evolved over the years. I don't usually clone this repo manually -- it is handled by some autoinstall script.

TO INSTALL:

Clone repo to ~/.vim (fork first if you'd like), then run `vim +PlugInstall +qa`.
If the above fails to initialize (i.e. you start vim, and you get errors), then
start vim and give the following commands: `:source vimrc` followed by
`:PlugInstall`.

FEATURES

* Plugins managed by VimPlug
* UI/workflow enhancements
* Understandable file structure
* Language support
+ Much more
